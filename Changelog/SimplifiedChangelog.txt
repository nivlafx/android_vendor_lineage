RiceDroid Update Changelogs
Rice Code: 8.0
Rice Version: Lomi - is a Filipino dish made with a variety of thick fresh egg noodles of about a quarter of an inch in diameter, soaked in lye water to give it more texture.[1] Because of its popularity at least in the eastern part of Batangas there are as many styles of cooking lomi as there are eateries, panciterias or restaurants offering the dish. Variations in recipes and quality are therefore very common.
